# Police Check Post Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset from police check posts containing around 4500 rows and 15 columns, including:

Date, time, location of stops


Driver demographics (gender, age, race)

Search and arrest details

The goal is to identify patterns in traffic violations and explore how factors like gender, age, and race influence stop outcomes.

### Key Questions Explored
* Were men or women stopped more often for speeding?

* Does gender affect who gets searched during a stop?

* What is the mean stop duration for any vehicle?

* How do age distributions vary for each type of traffic violation?

* Which ethnic group is more frequently involved in traffic violations?

* Which age group is primarily involved in violating driving rules?
